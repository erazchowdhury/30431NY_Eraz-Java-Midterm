***ANSWER ALL OF THE QUESTIONS BELOW***

Why do we need data structure?
Answer: Data structures allow us to store and modify data more efficiently. It allows for better organization of
data as well.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different data structures?
Answer: You can add or remove elements for different data structures. Some allow for access of any given element. Some
also have strict rules for adding or removing elements.
add, get, set, remove, clear, contains, indexOf, size, put, keySet, values, push, pop, peek, search, empty, offer, poll,
next, previous.

When would we use data structures in the real world?
Answer: You can use a data structure when you need to store any sort of information. Online shopping, customer order
information, getting to a destination etc.

What is an Array?
Answer: An Array is fixed in length. It can hold multiple values within it. Once it's created, it's length cannot be
changed.

What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
Answer: An Array is fixed in length but an ArrayList can change its length. It's elements can be added and removed
whenever. It's useful for storing data.

What is a LinkedList?
Answer: A LinkedList is another type of List that is resizable. Everytime a new element is added, the LinkedList just
inserts it within itself. Each element has knowledge of where the next element will be. It's useful for modifying a
group of data.

How is an Array different from LinkedList?
Answer: An Array is fixed in length but a LinkedList can be resized. A LinkedList's elements also have knowledge of
where the next element will be.

What is a Queue?
Answer: A Queue is like a line. New elements are added to the end of the list and elements are removed from the front.
This follows FIFO - First In First Out.

What is a Stack (referring to data structures)?
Answer: A Stack is also linear but follows LIFO - Last In First Out. New elements go to the top of the Stack and you can
only remove elements from the top.

What are FIFO and LIFO?
Answer: FIFO - First In First Out and LIFO - Last In First Out. They describe the way certain data structures add and
remove elements.

Explain Big O Notation?
Answer: Big O Notation refers to algorithmic efficiency for a given data set. It takes into account how efficient an
algorithm is at processing data the larger the size of that data is.

What is the best case to search an element from an array?
Answer: The best case is when the element is at the beginning of the Array.

What is the worst case to search an element from an array?
Answer: The worst case is when the element we want is at the end of the Array.

Describe what a tree data structure is?
Answer: A Tree is non-linear and stores data hierarchically within nodes. Each node of a tree stores a value and a list
of references to another node.

Describe what a graph data structure is?
Answer: A Graph is non-linear and consists of vertices and edges. The vertices are also known as nodes and the edges
are the lines that connect any two nodes. They are used to represent networks.

What is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Answer: A HashMap is non-synchronized, so it can't be shared between multiple threads, whereas a HashTable can support
multiple threads. A HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values whereas a Hashtable doesn't allow any null key
or value.

How do HashMaps work in Java? How do they store values, and when are they useful?
Answer: HashMaps stores entries in key-value pairs. Each key is unique and allows for quicker accessibility of an
element. The keys also have a separate type. When you want to access a value by a specific key, a HashMap is useful.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When does it occur?
Answer: It's exception that gets thrown when trying to access an element not within the given range of an Array.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Answer: You can use a for loop and assign each element from an array to another array. You can also use the
Object.clone() method, System.arraycopy() method, or Arrays.copyOf() method.

What is DFS and BFS?
Answer: DFS stands for Depth First Search and BFS stands for Breadth First Search. They are the two simplest graph
search algorithms. BFS walks through all nodes on the same level before moving on to the next level. DFS begins at the
root node and proceeds through the nodes as far as possible until we reach the node that has no unvisited nearby nodes.

What is Recursion?
Answer: Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself.

What are linear and non-linear data Structures?
Answer: Linear and non-linear just refers to how the elements within a collection are stored. Linear means the elements
are stored sequentially and are attached to its adjacent elements. There is only one level. Arrays, Stacks, Queues,
LinkedLists and sometimes HashMaps are linear. Non-linear data structures are attached hierarchically and can have
multiple levels. Trees and Graphs are non-linear.

Outline different sorting algorithms and their time complexities:
Selection Sort - O(n^2)
Bubble Sort - O(n^2)
Insertion Sort - O(n^2)
Heap Sort - O(n log(n))
Bucket Sort - O(n + k)
